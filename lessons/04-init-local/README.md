# Getting Started as a Team of One

**Overview of Working Without a Code Hosting Server**If you need to work offline, you should start here with the videos. This is several ways to start your project if you don't have a code hosting repository,such as GitLab.

**Initializing an Empty Project**
Use the command `git init` to start a new project locally. This creates an empty directory that you can now put stuff into.

**Converting an Existing Project to Git**
You can start with any folder of files and create a git repository from it, using the git init command. This time instead of starting with an empty directory, start with an existing directory of files and “convert” your non-versioned project into a git repository. Run the following commands: git init, git add, git commit. These will all be covered in more depth later on.

**Importing a Repository**
Previously you learned how to clone a project, this hooks up the remote server as a connection to your repository. You can also start with any folder which has a .git directory in it. For example: you could share your git repository with someone via a zipped email (AVOID doing this with a tool that does synchronization, such as Dropbox, as it will corrupt your git repository!!).
