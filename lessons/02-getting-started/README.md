# Getting Started with Hosted Git Repositories

**Overview of permission strategies**
Most of the people I've worked with are starting out with a project they need to collaborate with. They aren't starting with an empty folder, but rather with an existing project. I personally find it easier to tinker with something rather than stare at a blank screen. So the first thing we're going to do is set you up with a practice repository that I've created. You won't be able to edit *my* copy of the project, but you will be able to make edits to your own copy. Let's start with a review of permission strategies and the way a project can be setup with Git. Overview of permission strategies: Centralized, Branched, Patched, Forked.

**Creating a GitLab Account**
GitLab is a free code hosting platform which allows you to create private, and public repositories. It's also an open source product you can install behind your own firewall if you're working with a large team. It's not the most popular system out there, but I believe it offers the most flexibility to the widest range of people watching these videos. We'll get started with GitLab, and later in the lessons, I'll show you how to migrate your project to GitHub, which is currently one of the most popular code hosting platforms for open source projects. Git is distributed because work can be easily shared across multiple hosting systems. Create a GitLab account to store your first remote repository.

**Forking Your First Project**
Fork the GitLab sample project. We are forking so that you can upload your changes to your own repository. If you cloned from this project directly to your computer you wouldn't be able to upload your changes to the project (only “privileged” users can do that).

**Privatizing Your Repository**
Adjust the visibility of your forked repository to PRIVATE. Although this is completely optional, a lot of people feel more comfortable making mistakes when they know no one will see them.
