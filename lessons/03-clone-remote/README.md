# Downloading a Remote Repository

**Overview of Git at the Command Line**
Open up the command line, and check to see which version of Git you have installed. Look at Git's short help, list of all commands, and a single command. Recommend Stack Overflow / Google in additional to the command line help.

**Cloning your GitLab repository**
Review the instructions on GitLab to get the commands you need to run to download (“clone”) the remote repository. Issue the necessary commands at the command line.

**Reviewing History with git log**
Take a look at the work done in the repository to date. Compare against what's stored in the GitLab browser.
