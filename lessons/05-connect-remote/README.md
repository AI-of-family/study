# Connecting to Remote Repositories

**Overview of Connecting to Remotes**
You've been working locally, and suddenly you realize you could share your work with the upstream project. Depending on how you started your project, you will need to connect your local work in slightly different ways.

**Creating a Writeable Upstream Repository**
You initially cloned a repository that uses a forking repo. Now you need to go back and create an intermediate step on the code hosting platform that you can use to issue a pull request to.

**Converting a Set of Files to a Repository**
You initially started with a .zip folder with all the files, but not with the .git repository. You now want to submit an upstream patch, but you have absolutely no local history from the upstream project to connect with.

**Creating a Local Remote Repository**
You want to play with remotes, but you're entirely offline (for example: watching these videos behind a firewall and you can't get access to GitLab, GitHub, etc). Use a local directory as your “remote” repository. Remote actually just means any directory that's not THIS directory.
